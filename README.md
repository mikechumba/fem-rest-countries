## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - JS library

### What I learned

- Web Accessibility - I've been mentioning accessibility as an interest of mine for a while but I haven't done much to expand my knowledge of it until now. Some concepts I brushed up on include Semantic HTML and WAI-ARIA framwork
- VueJS

### Useful resources

- [Accessibility Checklist](https://www.coolfields.co.uk/2019/04/accessibility-checklist/) 
- [Accessible Custom Dropdown](https://dev.to/emmabostian/creating-a-custom-accessible-drop-down-3gmo) - I used this guide to replicate behaviours of the native select element.
- [Vue V3 Documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - Being my first vue project, the documentation really helped me out much that I didn't even use other tutorials.
- [WAI-ARIA Overview ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/)
- [Coder Coder's Response Web Design Course](https://coder-coder.com/responsive/) - This is a great course for anyone getting started on responsive web design.
